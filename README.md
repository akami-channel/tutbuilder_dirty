This project is for building my new tutorial series on OpenGL in C++ using SDL. Right now it's an elaborate copy-pasting machine that does a checksum on a directory. However, in the future it would be more customized. For example, if I need to edit every single bat file in each of the tutorial chapters, I will be able to do that here from one place, rather than changing things one-by-one in each directory.
